## 🔎SPECKit Plus:

SPECKit Plus is a Spec-Driven Development (SSD) toolkit designed to build flexible multi-agent AI systems by converting specifications into working implementations. It provides a structured development workflow that starts with defining project principles and guidelines and goes through specifications, breaking down tasks and implementation levels. It also provides reusable patterns and templates of reference projects other than working code.

## 🧩 Core Concepts of SPECKit Plus:

`/constitution` sets the foundational rules and principles that direct the entire development process to maintain quality and consistency.

`/specify` What needs to be built is defined here, including detailed requirements and user stories, forming a clear specification for the feature or project.

`/plan` This phase develops a technical roadmap outlining how to build the specified features, including architecture and tools.

`/task` breaks the implementation plan into small, actionable tasks that make the development process organized and trackable.

`/implementation` In this final step, the assigned tasks are executed to build a desired specified output with validation and progress tracking.
